# Fourier Transforms

This repository discusses about the mathematics involving in the Fourier Transform. 

In engineering, transformation of coordinate system of the problem is often applied to make equations simple and decoupled. Fourier Transform is such transformation which involves sine and consine functions of increasing frequency that provide orthogonal basis for the space of solution functions.

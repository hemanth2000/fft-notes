# Fourier Transforms

This repository is summary on Fourier Transform. 

In engineering, transformation of coordinate system of the problem is often applied to make equations simple and decoupled. Fourier Transform is such transformation which involves sine and consine functions of increasing frequency that provide orthogonal basis for the space of solution functions.

## Fourier Series

Fourier series is the represention of a function in terms of sines and consines of increasing frequencies.

## Gibbs Phenomenon

Gibbs phenomenon is observed at the discontinuities while representing using finite terms of fourier series.
